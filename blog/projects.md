# Projects

These are some personal projects that I have worked on. 

## Blog

[Website](https://www.mitchmcaffee.com)     /   [Github](https://github.com/themcaffee/themcaffee.github.io)

The site that you are on right now! This is my personal portfolio website and place for me to occasionaly post useful information. 


## Secret Santa

[Website](https://santa.mitchmcaffee.com)    /   [Github](https://github.com/themcaffee/secret-santa)

Dead simple website to help friends and family create a secret santa list, have others join it, and send out emails with the chosen recipients. Features an exclusion option to not get selected for significant others or others in your household as well as a gift ideas list to help shopping easier.


## Capture The Flag Challenges

[Github](https://github.com/themcaffee/UofU-CTF-Spring-2017)

These are some basic reverse engineering and buffer overflow challenges that I created for the 2017 University of Utah CTF. The solutions
to each of the challenges are included in the folder with the binary and source.


## Game of Life

[Github](https://github.com/themcaffee/game-of-life)

This is an experimental piece of software that pits neural networks created using genetic algorithms against each other. It is similar to
John Conway's game of life where there are organisms that live on a 2d plane. Unlike the original game of life, the organisms can decide 
from a subset of actions using a neural network.
