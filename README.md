This is my personal technical blog where I mash keys until something interesting comes out. It is built using VitePress and deployed
using Github Actions to Github Pages. If you want to learn how to build a VitePress blog, check out my post about it [here](https://www.mitchmcaffee.com/2022/writing-a-static-vue-blog).

To run this project locally with hot reloading:
```
yarn blog:dev
```
